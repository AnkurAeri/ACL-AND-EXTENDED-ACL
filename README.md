# ACL-AND-EXTENDED-ACL
Project Summary: A secured OSPF Network
Project Overview:

In this project aimed at implementation of OSPF based network, four networks of Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Central were designed, configured and implemented. Instead, the primary respons was to connect these networks along with several obligatory access control restrictions.

Key Tasks:

Network Design: Proscribed the network topology from the specifications provided such as subnets and routers connections.

OSPF Configuration: Deploy OSPF routing protocol over all the areas of the network so that there can be good communication between routers.

Access Control Implementation: Used the right ACLs to thwart any unauthorized connection that violates stated standards:
Sanctioned the Toronto users from tapping the Montreal network.

Access to be denied to the external server at Calgary PC2 and at Montreal PC4 but allow access to the Central network.

DNS Configuration: Designated the Cental Server to be a DNS server with the given domain name.

Testing and Verification: Verified working of the network connectivity, ACL, and DNS by carrying out tests on them to ascertain correct configuration.

Project Outcomes:

Implemented and designed a multiple area OSPF based network.
Implemented the use of access control lists in management of networks security policies.
Controlled the behavior of the network by blocking certain user or certain network to get the intended behavior.
Previous experience in design, developing and resolving issues to do with network at various levels.
For the infrastructure it met requirements relating to networking and given security measures, access control and OSPF routing brought practical and important experience for constructing secure and efficient networks.
